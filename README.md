# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### A description of the project

### The work proces

While working on this project I used the flex to position my
elements according to the Figma model, I have found the flexbox efficient enough, therefore I chose not to use grid. During the process, I used Figma, TinyPNG, Perfect pixel, and validators to make sure I don't have any validation errors.

In addition, this is my first time working with JS, I noticed that we should not add the black color to the like icon but i wanted to give it a try, hope that i did it the right way (considerd the matiral we covered on JS).
